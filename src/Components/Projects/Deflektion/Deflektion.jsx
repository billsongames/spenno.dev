            Deflektion is a simple collect 'em up style game with a continuously moving ball that needs to be guided through each level to collect the icons in the right order. 
            Influence the path of the ball by using deflektors to change its direction. 
            Various blocks will alter the path of the ball too. Some are advantageous and some are not. 
            Careful planning is needed to progress through each level.

            This was my second full game release and builds on my experience developing RotaDroid. 
            With challenging level design, a rigorous test process ensured that every level can be completed (as verified by me because I designed and completed them all üëç)
